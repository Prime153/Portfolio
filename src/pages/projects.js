The whole data is located in redux state, so itâ€™s very easy to manage it, from any part of the application. Items in basket are saved in local storage. When ordering, you can check the local weather conditions. I used OpenWeatherMap API for it. By going to subpages, you may notice some page flickering, it's beacause of scroll to top function. While browsing the store you may come across few pictures of my animals.",
